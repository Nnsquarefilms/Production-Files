            Raghava serves as both an Assistant Director and a Production Coordinator, bridging the gap between creative execution and on-set operations. His responsibilities include assisting the director with shot execution, managing props and set elements, and ensuring that production schedules are followed efficiently. His ability to handle on-set challenges while maintaining the film's visual and narrative coherence makes him a crucial part of the team.
